# Transfer learning of ScanNet for detecting ligand binding sites (LBS)
Hey, welcome to my repo! Here I am trying to perform transfer learning on ScanNet, a model for identifying amino acids involved in protein-protein interactions (PPI).
Currently, I am trying to train it on the scPDB, a subset of the PDB containing bound ligands.
Note that this is still in heavy development! Don't expect to be able to use this repo in its current form.
